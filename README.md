# Brick_Breaker Game

In the brick breaker game, the player moves a paddle from side to side to hit a BALL. The game
objective is to eliminate all of the BRICKS at the top of the screen by hitting them with the BALL.
But if the ball hit the bottom ENCLOSURE, the player loses and the game ends! To win the game,
all the BRICKS must be eliminated. The game is split into many levels, which must be completed
in sequence. There will be a time limit of 4 minutes and the remaining time will be shown with the
counter. The purpose of this game is to complete all the levels without losing all lives. The player
will have a maximum of 3 lives.

**LEVEL 1**

The basic game will consist of hitting the ball to direct it toward hitting the bricks above. When
the ball comes into contact with a brick, the brick will “break” and disappear. The player moves
the paddle from left to right to keep the ball from falling. Life is used when the player fails to hit
the ball. You have to display the number of lives left for the player on the screen. Display the
remaining lives on the screen with a HEART SHAPE.

**LEVEL 2**

Increased speed of the ball
Short length of the paddle
Each brick will require two hits to disappear and after the first hit, the brick changes color to a lighter one.

**LEVEL 3**

Some of the bricks are fixed (hitting them should bounce the ball back).
Normal bricks require 3 hits to disappear.
One random brick is a special brick. When this special brick is hit, 5 random bricks (orall the remaining bricks if less than 5) disappears.
Increased speed of the ball in this level.

Compatible with **masm615** and **DOSBox**
